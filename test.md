# **Project Plan -- Team 57**

##1 Introduction
A local university professor wants a program that captures statistics on the sentences in studentsâ€™ essays to help them improve their writing style. 
More specifically the professor desires a program that allows users, the students, the ability to find the average number of words in a sentence to help them keep track of the length of their sentences.

The introduction provides context for the project. Write a concise description of the software you will develop and its target users.

##2 Process Description

Process description as a set of activities; for each activity, provide the following:

- Activity name (verb or verb phrase)
- Activity description (concise paragraph)
- Entrance criteria (inputs needed for the activity)
- Exit criteria (outputs produced by the activity and how you know it has been completed satisfactorily)

*Activity Name:* Create Requirement Document
*Activity Description:* The team has to gather requirements and create a document specifying the user requirements and the system functional and non-functional requirements. 
*Entrance criteria:* Gather all requirements.
*Exit criteria:* A Requirements Document that contains descriptive user requirements as well as specific and testable functional and non-functional system requirements. Stakeholder sign-off on Requirements.

*Activity Name:* Generate Code
*Activity Description:* The team has to code a solution that will satisfy and comply with the requirements outlined in the requirements document.
*Entrance criteria:* There exists a completed requirements document.
*Exit criteria:* Working code that fulfils all requirements.

*Activity Name:* Test Code
*Activity Description:* The team has to develop test cases in order to ensure that the code complies with the specified requirements.
